// ============================================================================
// src/dormantProps.js — chapter-scoped persistent prop scaffolding.
//
// Problem: the old wave system rebuilt the depot, the hives, and (in the
// new design) the turrets + radio tower + EMP silo on demand at the start
// of whichever wave used them. The new design requires ALL of these
// elements to be VISIBLE (but inert) from the start of the chapter, and
// to progressively "activate" on their designated wave. This gives the
// arena a persistent, worked-on feel — at chapter start you can already
// see the depot you'll mine ore toward (wave 1), the derelict turret
// platforms you'll power up (wave 2), the shielded hives you'll later
// destroy (wave 3), and the herd staging pens (wave 4) — and each wave
// simply flips a few state bits to bring the relevant props to life.
//
// This module doesn't OWN the props (they live in their original modules:
// ores.js for the depot, spawners.js for the hives, a new turrets.js in
// stage 2, etc.) — it's a coordination layer that decides WHEN to hand
// control to each owner.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   onChapterStart(chapterIdx) — called the FIRST TIME a wave in a new
//     chapter begins (localWave === 1). Spawns every dormant prop for
//     the chapter in its "inactive" visual state.
//   onChapterEnd()              — called when the chapter finishes (boss
//     dies, wave 5 complete). Tears down every prop so the next chapter
//     can rebuild from a clean slate. Also called on resetWaves().
//   isChapterPrepared()         — true if onChapterStart has run for the
//     current chapter and the teardown hasn't happened yet. waves.js uses
//     this to decide whether to call onChapterStart on wave 1 entry.
//
// Stage 1 scope: depot + hive shields. Turrets, radio tower, EMP silo,
// and herd pens come in stage 2 / 3.
